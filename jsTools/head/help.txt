Usage: head [OPTION]... [FILE]...
Print first 10 lines of each FILE to standard output.
With more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving the file name.
With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

  -c, --bytes=SIZE         print first SIZE bytes
  -n, --lines=NUMBER       print first NUMBER lines instead of first 10
  -q, --quiet, --silent    never print headers giving file names
  -v, --verbose            always print headers giving file names
      --help               display this help and exit
      --version            output version information and exit

SIZE may have a multiplier suffix: b for 512, k for 1K, m for 1 Meg.
If -VALUE is used as first OPTION, read -c VALUE when one of
multipliers bkm follows concatenated, else read -n VALUE.
